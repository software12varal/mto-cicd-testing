#Work on this Project with the following rules ðŸ“‘ âš¡âš¡âš¡

	1. For easy readability and debugging: Comment on every function/class
	2. Always add Requirements.txt and avoid pushing the Virtual env
	3. ReadMe should be updated with Very important changes and contraints
	4. Always Pull before pushing
	5. While pushing, create/use a branch with you name; make a pull request from that branch( to avoid merge conflict)  
	6. If you have an issue that needs everyone's attention, create issue on the main repository



	
#Goal : Push quality, maintainable code ðŸ’¡

#Any Major Changes that need ATTENTION here:ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡
 

1. Varal-Jobs-Portal

I have managed to add 3 databases to the project. All ot them working fine in the admin and when saving data.

##### NOTE:
-You cannot add MTOs in the admin panel but they can sign up using the register page. 
-This is because of cross relationships of the databases(foreign key) which django currently does no allow.
-This is not perfect but it is a solid start.

2. Updated database can now save
