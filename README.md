#### Varal-Jobs-Portal

I have managed to add 3 databases to the project. All ot them working fine in the admin and when saving data.

#####NOTE:
-You cannot add MTOs in the admin panel but they can sign up using the register page. 
-This is because of cross relationships of the databases(foreign key) which django currently does no allow.
-This is not perfect but it is a solid start.
