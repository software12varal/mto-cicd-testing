#Work on this Project with the following rules ðŸ“‘ âš¡âš¡âš¡

	1. For easy readability and debugging: Comment on every function/class
	2. Always add Requirements.txt and avoid pushing the Virtual env
	3. ReadMe should be updated with Very important changes and contraints
	4. Always Pull before pushing
	5. While pushing, create/use a branch with you name; make a pull request from that branch( to avoid merge conflict)  
	6. If you have an issue that needs everyone's attention, create issue on the main repository
