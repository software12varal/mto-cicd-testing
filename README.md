#Work on this Project with the following rules ðŸ“‘ âš¡âš¡âš¡

	1. For easy readability and debugging: Comment on every function/class
	2. Always add Requirements.txt and avoid pushing the Virtual env
	3. ReadMe should be updated with the constraints
	4. Always Pull before pushing
	5. While pushing, create/use a branch with you name; make a pull request from that branch( to avoid merge conflict)  
	6. If you have an issue that needs everyone's attention, create issue on the main repository

1. Varal-Jobs-Portal

I have managed to add 3 databases to the project. All ot them working fine in the admin and when saving data.

##### NOTE:
-You cannot add MTOs in the admin panel but they can sign up using the register page. 
-This is because of cross relationships of the databases(foreign key) which django currently does no allow.
-This is not perfect but it is a solid start.
